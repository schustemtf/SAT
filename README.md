# SAT Solving

My solutions for the projects of the [SAT Solving](https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/sat/ss23/) course by Prof. Armin Biere at the University of Freibrug.

We develop a simple DPLL SAT solver, which we then made more efficient week by week, by adding faster but more complex techniques, like [Conflict-driven clause learning](https://users.aalto.fi/~tjunttil/2022-DP-AUT/notes-sat/cdcl.html) or Watched literals.
